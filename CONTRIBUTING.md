# Getting Involved

Code patches are not the only way to get involved: you can help the project by reporting bugs, improving docs, helping
others on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/metreeca/type/issues), telling the world about Metreeca… ;-)

# Reporting Bugs

Before opening an [issue](https://github.com/metreeca/type/issues) to report a bug, search open issues for similar cases
and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.

If you've really found a new bug, creating a helpful report using the dedicated template will make fixing it much easier
and quicker.

If you just want some help with the framework or your project, start
a [discussion](https://github.com/metreeca/type/discussions) and describe your problem.
